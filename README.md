# Perceptron-Classifier-Normal-RewardPunishment-Pocket-KeslerConstruction-
Perceptron is a powerful algorithm to classify two or multi class data. Here we implemented four versions of perceptron algorithm. Those are, for two class: Normal Algorithm, Reward Punishment Algorithm, Pocket Algorithm; For Multi Class: Kesler's Construction. We used IRIS dataset for our training and test samples.
